The architecture is structured as follows:  \\n\\n---\\n\\n### 1. Data Gathering and Preparation  \\n- Data Sources:  \\n  - Gather paper graphs (e.g. from arXiv) with nodes as authors and edges as paper dependencies.  \\n  - Collect paper reviews (e.g. from arXiv) with nodes as reviewers and edges as paper dependencies.  \\n  - Collect paper camera-ready versions (e.g. from arXiv) with nodes as authors and edges as paper dependencies.  \\n- Preprocessing:  \\n  - Normalize paper graphs and reviews.  \\n  - Apply graph convolutional transformations to capture paper dependencies and author interactions.  \\n-  \\n  ### 2.  \\n  ### 3.  \\n  ### 4.  \\n  ### 5.  \\n  ### 6.  \\n  ### 7.  \\n  ### 8.  \\n  ### 9.  \\n  ### 10.  \\n  ### 11.  \\n  ### 12.  \\n  ### 13.  \\n  ### 14.  \\n  ### 15.  \\n  ### 16.  \\n  ### 17.  \\n  ### 18.  \\n  ### 19.  \\n  ### 20.  \\n  ### 21.  \\n  ### 22.  \\n  ### 23.  \\n  ### 24.  \\n  ### 25.  \\n  ### 26.  \\n  ### 27.  \\n  ### 28.  \\n  ### 29.  \\n  ### 30.  \\n  ### 31.  \\n  ### 32.  \\n  ### 33.  \\n  ### 34.  \\n  ### 35.  \\n  ### 36.  \\n  ### 37.  \\n  ### 38.  \\n  ### 39.  \\n  ### 40.  \\n  ### 41.  \\n  ### 42.  \\n  ### 43.  \\n  ### 44.  \\n  ### 45.  \\n  ### 46.  \\n  ### 47.  \\n  ### 48.  \\n  ### 49.  \\n  ### 50.  \\n  ### 51.  \\n  ### 52.  \\n  ### 53.  \\n  ### 54.  \\n  ### 55.  \\n  ### 56.  \\n  ### 57.  \\n  ### 58.  \\n  ### 59.  \\n  ### 60.  \\n  ### 61.  \\n  ### 62.  \\n  ### 63.  \\n  ### 64.  \\n  ### 65.  \\n  ### 66.  \\n  ### 67.  \\n  ### 68.  \\n  ### 69.  \\n  ### 70.  \\n  ### 71.  \\n  ### 72.  \\n  ### 73.  \\n  ### 74.  \\n  ### 75.  \\n  ### 76.  \\n  ### 77.  \\n  ### 78.  \\n  ### 79.  \\n  ### 80.  \\n  ### 81.  \\n  ### 82.  \\n  ### 83.  \\n  ### 84.  \\n  ### 85.  \\n  ### 86.  \\n  ### 87.  \\n  ### 88.  \\n  ### 89.  \\n  ### 90.  \\n  ### 91.  \\n  ### 92.  \\n  ### 93.  \\n  ### 94.  \\n  ### 95.  \\n  ### 96.  \\n  ### 97.  \\n  ### 98.  \\n  ### 99.  \\n  ### 100.  \\n  ### 101.  \\n  ### 102.  \\n  ### 103.  \\n  ### 104.  \\n  ### 105.  \\n  ### 106.  \\n  ### 107.  \\n  ### 108.  \\n  ### 109.  \\n  ### 110.  \\n  ### 111.  \\n  ### 112.  \\n  ### 113.  \\n  ### 114.  \\n  ### 115.  \\n  ### 116.  \\n  ### 117.  \\n  ### 118.  \\n  ### 119.  \\n  ### 120.  \\n  ### 121.  \\n  ### 122.  \\n  ### 123.  \\n  ### 124.  \\n  ### 125.  \\n  ### 126.  \\n  ### 127.  \\n  ### 128.  \\n  ### 129.  \\n  ### 130.  \\n  ### 131.  \\n  ### 132.  \\n  ### 133.  \\n  ### 134.  \\n  ### 135.  \\n  ### 136.  \\n  ### 137.  \\n  ### 138.  \\n  ### 139.  \\n  ### 140.  \\n  ### 141.  \\n  ### 142.  \\n  ### 143.  \\n  ### 144.  \\n  ### 145.  \\n  ### 146.  \\n  ### 147.  \\n  ### 148.  \\n  ### 149.  \\n  ### 150.  \\n  ### 151.  \\n  ### 152.  \\n  ### 153.  \\n  ### 154.  \\n  ### 155.  \\n  ### 156.  \\n  ### 157.  \\n  ### 158.  \\n  ### 159.  \\n  ### 160.  \\n  ### 161.  \\n  ### 162.  \\n  ### 163.  \\n  ### 164.  \\n  ### 165.  \\n  ### 166.  \\n  ### 167.  \\n  ### 168.  \\n  ### 169.  \\n  ### 170.  \\n  ### 171.  \\n  ### 172.  \\n  ### 173.  \\n  ### 174.  \\n  ### 175.  \\n  ### 176.  \\n  ### 177.  \\n  ### 178.  \\n  ### 179.  \\n  ### 180.  \\n  ### 181.  \\n  ### 182.  \\n  ### 183.  \\n  ### 184.  \\n  ### 185.  \\n  ### 186.  \\n  ### 187.  \\n  ### 188.  \\n  ### 189.  \\n  ### 190.  \\n  ### 191.  \\n  ### 192.  \\n  ### 193.  \\n  ### 194.  \\n  ### 195.  \\n  ### 196.
