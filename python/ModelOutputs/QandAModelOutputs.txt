[{'generated_text': 'Given the research question in Question, create an Artificial Intelligence Apporach to solve it in Approach. \n\nQuestion: For most academic conferences, authors first submit initial papers, and then get reviews from some human reviewers. If the paper is accepted, the authors are required to submit a camera-ready version after modifying based on some required damaging issues. How can AI be used to analyze how well authors followed the reviews to modify papers in camera-ready versions?  \\n\\nApproach:  \\nThe paper proposes a hybrid architecture combining a CNN-based feature extraction module and a Transformer-based attention module to address this question.
