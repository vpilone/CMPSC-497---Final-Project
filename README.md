PLease not that all the project files are within the Python Folder. To reproduce my results, the general workflow is as follows:

Download the "research paper" database.
Run "buildDatabase.py" to build the database.
Create "databaseSeperated.csv", a version of the database with no thinking step and question, apporach columns"
Run "assembleDatabase" to create the testing and training splits
Run "Trainer.py" to train the model
Run "compareModels.py" to compare the model performances.
